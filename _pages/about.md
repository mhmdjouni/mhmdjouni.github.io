Biography
===
I am a research engineer of the Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique Laboratory (GIPSA-Lab) at the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes (UGA), Grenoble, France, as of June 2024.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at GIPSA-Lab at Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP), Grenoble, France, since 2021.
I received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Signal and Image Processing from the Grenoble INP and the UGA in 2017 and 2021, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Comon and Prof. Mauro Dalla Mura, and the B.Eng. degree in Computer and Communications Engineering from the Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2016.
In 2019 and 2023, I was a visiting researcher for 10 and 6 weeks, respectively, at the Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), Tokyo, Japan.

Research Interests
===
I work in the field of computational and multimodal imaging, applied mainly on remote sensing and hyperspectral imaging data.
I have dealt with a wide range of topics ranging from image processing based on tensor algebra, to hyperspectral reconstruction based on Fabry-Perot interferometry and inverse problems, arriving at multimodal image fusion and technology transfer.
My main topics of interest are:
* Computational imaging
* Multimodal imaging
* Tensor algebra
* Hybrid AI
* Technology transfer
